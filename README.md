Self-learning genetic algorithms for computation planning in distributed systems, 2015

In this diploma work self-learning GA is used to solve the following classic NP-hard problems:
- job scheduling problem;
- subset sum problem.

Test generator was created for the two problems - you may find it in test_generator directory.
